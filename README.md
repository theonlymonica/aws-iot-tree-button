# AWS IoT Tree Button

This repository contains the source code for the IoT solution described in my blog post ["Push the Green Button: Creating Event Gadgets with IoT and Serverless Architecture"](https://letsmake.cloud/push-the-green-button-creating-event-gadgets-with-iot-and-serverless-architecture). The solution utilizes an IoT button, AWS Lambda, and an IoT-connected printer to create an interactive and sustainable giveaway for events.
